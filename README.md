# Stardew.ItemLibrary
Exposes Stardew Valley item IDs

## Usage
This project is intended to allow more convenient use of items in mod entries, providing named access in code as well as a framework for item metadata usage.

The project only needs to be run to regenerate the Item list if Stardew Valley receives an update which adds new items, or modifies any existing item metadata.
